Runtime Capabilities Module.

This module provides runtime capabilities that can be exposed via MCP/API services.
These are distinct from dev-only tools in the tools/ directory.

Capabilities include:
- analyzers: Quality, content, structure analysis
- checkers: Link validation
- monitors: Health monitoring

Usage:
    from ai_collab_kb.capabilities.analyzers import QualityAnalyzer
    from ai_collab_kb.capabilities.checkers import LinkChecker
    from ai_collab_kb.capabilities.monitors import HealthMonitor

MCP Tools exposed:
    - analyze_quality: QualityAnalyzer.analyze_file()
    - analyze_content: ContentAnalyzer.analyze()
    - check_structure: StructureChecker.check()
    - check_links: LinkChecker.check()
    - get_health: HealthMonitor.get_status()
