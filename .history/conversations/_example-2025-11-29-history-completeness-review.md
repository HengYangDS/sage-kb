## Context

Reviewed the `.history` directory structure to identify missing or incomplete content. This conversation established
templates and documentation patterns for AI session history management.

---

## Key Discussion Points

### Directory Structure Analysis

Examined the three subdirectories (`conversations/`, `current/`, `handoffs/`) and found all were empty despite having a
well-documented `index.md` explaining their purpose.

### Template Gap Identification

Identified that while the directory structure and naming conventions were defined, no actual templates existed to help
create consistent records.

## Decisions Made

| Decision                                 | Rationale                               | Impact                                      |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Create three session templates           | Standardize documentation format        | Enables consistent AI collaboration records |
| Store templates in `content/templates/`  | Follows existing knowledge organization | Templates accessible project-wide           |
| Add example files to `.history/` subdirs | Demonstrate expected usage              | Reduces ambiguity for new users             |

## Action Items

- [x] Create `conversation_record.md` template
- [x] Create `session_state.md` template
- [x] Create `task_handoff.md` template
- [x] Update `content/templates/index.md`
- [x] Add example files to `.history/` subdirectories

## Learnings & Insights

### What Worked Well

- Existing `index.md` provided clear naming conventions
- Template format standard in project made creation straightforward

### Future Considerations

- Consider automated session logging integration
- May need retention automation for 30-day policy
