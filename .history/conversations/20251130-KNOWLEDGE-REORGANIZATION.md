# Knowledge Reorganization - 2025-11-30

## Context

User requested analysis and execution of knowledge reorganization across the project's knowledge directories (
`.context`, `content`, `docs`, `.history`), addressing four key questions:

1. What generic knowledge in `.context` should be moved to `content`
2. What project-specific knowledge in `content` should be moved to `.context`
3. What knowledge in `docs` should be consolidated
4. Why `.history` documents haven't been updated

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Generic Knowledge Migration (.context → content)

**Rationale**: `.context/intelligence/` contained reusable patterns mixed with project-specific data

**Actions**:

- Created `.knowledge/practices/engineering/COMMON_PITFALLS.md` (539 lines) - generic pitfalls guide
- Created `.knowledge/practices/ai_collaboration/INTERACTION_PATTERNS.md` (283 lines) - generic AI patterns
- Updated `.context/intelligence/learning/COMMON_PITFALLS.md` to slim reference (88 lines) with SAGE-specific pitfalls only
- Updated `.context/intelligence/calibration/PATTERNS.md` to slim reference (100 lines) with SAGE-specific calibration data only
- Kept `OPTIMIZATIONS.md` and `PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` in `.context/` (SAGE-specific conventions)

### Decision 2: Project-Specific Content Migration (content → docs)

**Rationale**: `.knowledge/references/` contained SAGE-specific API documentation that doesn't belong in distributable
content

**Actions**:

- Moved `docs/api/MCP.md` → `docs/api/MCP_QUICK_REF.md`
- Moved `docs/api/PLUGIN_QUICK_REF.md` → `docs/api/PLUGIN_QUICK_REF.md`
- Updated `docs/api/INDEX.md` with new Quick References section

### Decision 3: Cross-References Between Design Docs and ADRs

**Rationale**: Design documents should reference their corresponding Architecture Decision Records

**Actions**:

- Updated `docs/design/01-ARCHITECTURE.md` with ADR references (0001, 0004, 0005, 0006)
- Updated `docs/design/02-SAGE-PROTOCOL.md` with ADR-0002 reference
- Updated `docs/design/04-TIMEOUT-LOADING.md` with ADR-0003 and timeout policy references

### Decision 4: Session History Activation

**Rationale**: `.history/` only contained example templates, no actual records were being created

**Actions**:

- Added Session History Management section to `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` with:
    - Record type table
    - Session end checklist
    - Naming conventions
- Created `.history/_SESSION-END-CHECKLIST.md` (143 lines) - detailed checklist template
- Created `.context/intelligence/automation/SESSION_AUTOMATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` (247 lines) - long-term automation plan

## Outcomes

### Files Created

- `.knowledge/practices/engineering/COMMON_PITFALLS.md`
- `.knowledge/practices/ai_collaboration/INTERACTION_PATTERNS.md`
- `.history/_SESSION-END-CHECKLIST.md`
- `.context/intelligence/automation/SESSION_AUTOMATION_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.history/conversations/2025-11-30-KNOWLEDGE-REORGANIZATION.md` (this file)

### Files Modified

- `.context/intelligence/learning/COMMON_PITFALLS.md` (reduced from 541 to 88 lines)
- `.context/intelligence/calibration/PATTERNS.md` (reduced from 277 to 100 lines)
- `docs/api/INDEX.md` (added Quick References section)
- `docs/design/01-ARCHITECTURE.md` (added ADR references)
- `docs/design/02-SAGE-PROTOCOL.md` (added ADR reference)
- `docs/design/04-TIMEOUT-LOADING.md` (added ADR and policy references)
- `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` (added Session History Management section)

### Files Moved

- `docs/api/MCP.md` → `docs/api/MCP_QUICK_REF.md`
- `docs/api/PLUGIN_QUICK_REF.md` → `docs/api/PLUGIN_QUICK_REF.md`
## Session Continuation: Configuration Verification

### Question 5: Configuration File Adjustments

**Analysis performed on configuration files:**

| Config File                      | Status  | Notes                                               |
|----------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `config/knowledge/content.yaml`  | ✓ Valid | `references` directory still valid (2 files remain) |
| `config/knowledge/triggers.yaml` | ✓ Valid | No references to moved files                        |
| `config/knowledge/loading.yaml`  | ✓ Valid | `always` list files exist                           |
| `config/sage.yaml`               | ✓ Valid | Abstract paths, no direct file refs                 |

**Configuration Status**: All configuration files use abstract directory references (`.knowledge/references/`) rather
than
specific file paths. The `.knowledge/references/` directory still exists with `KNOWLEDGE_QUICK_REF.md` and
`PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`, so no configuration changes were needed.

### Broken Reference Fixes

**Found and fixed broken references to moved files:**

| File                                                 | Old Reference                         | New Reference                  |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `.knowledge/scenarios/mcp_integration/CONTEXT.md`    | `docs/api/MCP.md`    | `docs/api/MCP_QUICK_REF.md`    |
| `.knowledge/scenarios/plugin_development/CONTEXT.md` | `docs/api/PLUGIN_QUICK_REF.md` | `docs/api/PLUGIN_QUICK_REF.md` |

**Ignored references (historical/temporary):**

- `.history/conversations/2025-11-30-KNOWLEDGE-REORGANIZATION.md` - Historical record
- `.outputs/*.py` - Temporary analysis scripts

---

## Learnings

1. **Knowledge Classification Principle**:
    - `.context/` = Project-specific (ADRs, conventions, calibration data)
    - `.knowledge/` = Generic, distributable (patterns, practices, frameworks)
    - `docs/` = User-facing documentation (guides, API references)

2. **Session History Gap**: The `.history/` system was well-designed but lacked integration with AI collaboration
   workflows. Short-term solution is explicit instructions; long-term solution is automation via hooks and plugins.

3. **Cross-Reference Value**: Linking design docs to ADRs improves traceability and helps understand "why" behind
   designs.

## Session Continuation 2: Deep Optimization Iteration

### Context

User requested another iteration of knowledge reorganization optimization following the principles of high cohesion, low
coupling, and reducing information redundancy.

### Decision 5: Further Intelligence File Refactoring

**Rationale**: `OPTIMIZATIONS.md` (489 lines) and `PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` (391 lines) still contained significant
generic content mixed with SAGE-specific data.

**Actions**:

- Refactored `.context/intelligence/optimization/OPTIMIZATIONS.md`: 489 → 201 lines
    - Extracted generic code patterns to reference `.knowledge/practices/engineering/`
    - Kept SAGE-specific: import organization, test coverage goals, loading optimizations, common patterns (singleton,
      config, events), project shortcuts
- Refactored `.context/intelligence/optimization/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md`: 391 → 149 lines
    - Extracted generic performance patterns to reference `.knowledge/frameworks/performance/`
    - Kept SAGE-specific: performance goals with actual measurements, benchmarks (P50/P95/P99), monitoring thresholds,
      tuning checklist

### Decision 6: Index File Updates

**Rationale**: Index files needed updates to reflect reorganized content

**Actions**:

- Updated `.context/INDEX.md`:
    - Added `SESSION_AUTOMATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` to intelligence section
    - Updated file count from 7 to 8
- Updated `.knowledge/INDEX.md`:
    - Added References layer (2 files: `KNOWLEDGE_QUICK_REF.md`, `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`)
    - Updated total file count from ~114 to ~116
    - Added References section to Complete File List
- Updated `docs/INDEX.md`:
    - Updated API file count from 4 to 6
    - Added `MCP_QUICK_REF.md` and `PLUGIN_QUICK_REF.md` to API table

### Validation Results

**Cross-reference validation**:

- All references to old paths (`docs/api/MCP.md`, `docs/api/PLUGIN_QUICK_REF.md`) only in
  historical/temporary files
- All new references in refactored files point to existing files:
    - `.knowledge/practices/engineering/PATTERNS.md` ✓
    - `.knowledge/practices/engineering/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` ✓
    - `.knowledge/frameworks/performance/OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGIES.md` ✓
    - `.knowledge/frameworks/performance/CACHING_PATTERNS.md` ✓
    - `.knowledge/practices/engineering/PROFILING_GUIDE.md` ✓

**Session history status**:

- System is active: This conversation record exists as proof
- Templates still available for reference (prefixed with `_example-`)

### Summary of All Optimizations

| File                                          | Before   | After   | Reduction |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| `.context/intelligence/learning/COMMON_PITFALLS.md`    | 541      | 88      | 84%       |
| `.context/intelligence/calibration/PATTERNS.md`           | 277      | 100     | 64%       |
| `.context/intelligence/optimization/OPTIMIZATIONS.md`      | 489      | 201     | 59%       |
| `.context/intelligence/optimization/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` | 391      | 149     | 62%       |
| **Total**                                     | **1698** | **538** | **68%**   |

### Learnings (Iteration 2)

1. **Reference Pattern**: Slimmed `.context/intelligence/` files now follow consistent pattern:
    - Generic References table at top
    - SAGE-specific content only in body
    - Related section pointing to both generic and project-specific docs

2. **Index Maintenance**: After reorganization, all three index files (`.context/`, `.knowledge/`, `docs/`) need updates
   for file counts and listings.

3. **Validation Importance**: Cross-reference validation ensures no broken links after moves/refactors.

---

## Session Continuation 3: Rules Solidification

### Context

User requested "固化规则性的东西和知识" (Solidify rules and knowledge) - consolidating the rule-based patterns
established during optimization sessions into permanent, referenceable guidelines.

### Decision 7: Guidelines Enhancement

**Rationale**: The `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` was missing key rules established during recent optimization work.

**Actions**:

- Added new "📝 Documentation Standards" section with:
    - Document Format Rules table (header, TOC, sections, related, footer)
    - Knowledge Placement Rules table (where content types belong)
    - Index Maintenance Rules (steps after file changes)
- Added "Documentation Standards" reference to References section

### Rules Solidified

| Rule Category           | Location                     | Content                                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Document Format**     | `.junie/GUIDELINES.md`       | Header, TOC, sections, related, footer rules           |
| **Knowledge Placement** | `.junie/GUIDELINES.md`       | `.context/` vs `.knowledge/` vs `docs/` vs `.history/` |
| **Index Maintenance**   | `.junie/GUIDELINES.md`       | Update counts, listings, cross-refs after changes      |
| **Full Standards**      | `DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` | Complete SSOT for documentation                        |

### Learnings (Iteration 3)

1. **Rule Consolidation**: Guidelines file should be the single entry point for all project rules, with references to
   detailed documents for specifics.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Keep guidelines concise with tables; link to full documentation for details.

3. **SSOT Pattern**: Rules established during sessions should be captured in permanent documentation, not just
   conversation records.

---

## Session Continuation 4: Token Efficiency Optimization

### Context

User requested deep optimization focusing on:

1. Identifying knowledge/norms that should be consolidated into `.knowledge/` as generic standards
2. Making `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` reference generic standards instead of duplicating
3. Deep restructuring based on token efficiency and role clarity
4. Solidifying rules into appropriate locations

### Decision 8: Guidelines Deduplication

**Rationale**: `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` contained duplicated content that exists in generic standards files.

**Actions**:

- Refactored Coding Standards section: 25 lines → 8 lines
    - Added references to `.knowledge/guidelines/PYTHON.md` and `.context/conventions/NAMING.md`
    - Kept quick summary for immediate reference
- Condensed Session History Management: 25 lines → 6 lines
    - Added reference to `.history/INDEX.md` and `.history/_SESSION-END-CHECKLIST.md`
- Condensed Expert Committee Pattern: 8 lines → 5 lines
    - Added reference to `.knowledge/frameworks/cognitive/EXPERT_COMMITTEE.md`
- Added reference to Timeout Hierarchy section
    - Linked to `.context/policies/TIMEOUT_HIERARCHY.md`
### Decision 9: Convention File Optimization

**Rationale**: `.context/conventions/NAMING.md` duplicated generic Python naming conventions.

**Actions**:

- Refactored `.context/conventions/NAMING.md`: 306 → 271 lines (12% reduction)
    - Replaced detailed Python conventions (sections 1-2) with reference to `.knowledge/guidelines/PYTHON.md`
    - Kept SAGE-specific principles and quick reference summary
    - Renumbered all sections (7 sections total now)

### Summary of Session 4 Optimizations

| File                                      | Before    | After     | Reduction |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` (Coding Standards) | 25 lines  | 8 lines   | 68%       |
| `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` (Session History)  | 25 lines  | 6 lines   | 76%       |
| `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` (Expert Committee) | 8 lines   | 5 lines   | 38%       |
| `.context/conventions/NAMING.md`          | 306 lines | 271 lines | 12%       |

### Cumulative Optimization Results (All Sessions)

| Category                 | Files   | Total Reduction        |
|--------------------------|---------|------------------------|
| `.context/intelligence/` | 4 files | 68% (1698 → 538 lines) |
| `.context/conventions/`  | 1 file  | 12% (306 → 271 lines)  |
| `.junie/GUIDELINES.md`   | 1 file  | ~20% in key sections   |

### Learnings (Iteration 4)

1. **Reference-First Pattern**: Guidelines and convention files should reference generic standards rather than
   duplicating content, keeping only project-specific customizations and quick summaries inline.

2. **Token Efficiency Principle**: Each file should have a clear role - either be the source of truth for generic
   content (in `.knowledge/`) or reference it (in `.context/` and `.junie/`).

3. **Quick Summary Value**: Even when referencing external files, keeping a 2-3 line quick summary provides immediate
   value without context-switching.

4. **Audit Methodology**: Systematic audit of all directories (`.junie/`, `.context/`, `.knowledge/`, `docs/`) reveals
   duplication patterns that can be systematically addressed.

## Session Continuation 5: Session History Management Consolidation

### Context

User asked "session history management 难道不应该沉淀到 content?" (Shouldn't session history management be consolidated
into content?) - questioning whether the session management practices in `.history/` should be generic reusable
knowledge in `.knowledge/`.

### Analysis

**Found existing structure**:

- `.knowledge/practices/ai_collaboration/SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md` (321 lines) — Full session management practices ✓
- `.knowledge/templates/` — Session templates (conversation_record, session_state, task_handoff) ✓
- `.history/_SESSION-END-CHECKLIST.md` (143 lines) — Workflow checklist with templates

**Issue identified**: `.history/_SESSION-END-CHECKLIST.md` contained generic content (quality checks, cleanup actions,
decision guide) that overlapped with but wasn't fully covered by `SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md`.

### Decision 10: Create Generic Session Checklist

**Rationale**: The checklist workflow pattern is generic and reusable across projects, separate from session management
theory.

**Actions**:

- Created `.knowledge/practices/ai_collaboration/SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` (159 lines)
    - Session Start checklist
    - During Session checklist
    - Pre-Completion checks (work verification, quality, code review)
    - Session End checklist (documentation, cleanup, handoff)
    - Decision Guide (when to create which records)
    - Quick Reference Card

- Refactored `.history/_SESSION-END-CHECKLIST.md`: 143 → 72 lines (50% reduction)
    - Now references generic checklist
    - Keeps only SAGE-specific additions (timeout levels, EventBus, DI)
    - Includes project paths and template locations

- Updated `.knowledge/practices/INDEX.md`: Added SESSION_CHECKLIST.md (7 → 8 files in AI Collaboration)
- Updated `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` Session History section:
    - Now references generic checklist in `.knowledge/`
    - References project-specific checklist in `.history/`
    - Points to templates in `.knowledge/templates/`
### Knowledge Structure Clarified

| Content Type                | Location                                 | Example                                         |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Generic practices**       | `.knowledge/practices/ai_collaboration/` | `SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md`, `SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` |
| **Generic templates**       | `.knowledge/templates/`                  | `CONVERSATION_RECORD.md`, `TASK_HANDOFF.md`     |
| **Project-specific config** | `.history/`                              | `_SESSION-END-CHECKLIST.md` (SAGE additions)    |
| **Instance data**           | `.history/`                              | Actual conversation records, handoffs           |

### Files Changed

| File                                                         | Action     | Lines    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|
| `.knowledge/practices/ai_collaboration/SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` | Created    | 159      |
| `.history/_SESSION-END-CHECKLIST.md`                         | Refactored | 143 → 72 |
| `.knowledge/practices/INDEX.md`                              | Updated    | +1 line  |
| `.junie/GUIDELINES.md`                                       | Updated    | ~4 lines |

### Learnings (Iteration 5)

1. **Checklist vs Practice**: Checklists (quick reference workflow) are distinct from practices (comprehensive
   guidance). Both are generic and belong in `.knowledge/`.

2. **Three-Layer Pattern for Session Management**:
    - Practices (`.knowledge/practices/`) — Theory and comprehensive guidance
    - Templates (`.knowledge/templates/`) — Document structure blueprints
    - Checklists (`.knowledge/practices/`) — Quick-reference workflows

3. **Instance vs Pattern**: `.history/` stores instance data (actual records) while `.knowledge/` stores patterns (how
   to
   create records).

---

## Session Continuation 6: Validation Audit

### Context

User requested to continue the optimization work. This iteration performed a comprehensive validation audit to verify
all previous optimizations are complete and properly implemented.

### Audit Results

#### `.context/conventions/` Audit

| File                | Status        | Notes                                        |

### Validation Summary

**All optimizations verified complete:**

1. **Knowledge Placement** — All content in appropriate directories
    - Generic → `.knowledge/`
    - Project-specific → `.context/`
    - User documentation → `docs/`
    - Session records → `.history/`
2. **Reference Pattern** — Project-specific files reference generic standards

    - `.context/policies/TIMEOUT_HIERARCHY.md` references `.knowledge/frameworks/resilience/`
    - `.junie/GUIDELINES.md` references all relevant generic standards

3. **No Remaining Issues** — Audit found no further optimization opportunities

### Final Statistics (All Sessions)

| Category                             | Optimization                                                 |

## Session Continuation 7: Session History Automation

### Context

User asked "上述流程如何能更自动化触发" (How can the above workflow be triggered more automatically) - requesting
automation for the session history management workflow established in previous sessions.

### Analysis

**Current State**:

- Session automation requirements documented in `.context/intelligence/automation/SESSION_AUTOMATION_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- No MCP tools implemented for session management
- No CLI commands for sessions
- Manual workflow only

**Options Evaluated**:

- **A**: Instruction enhancement only (no code)
- **B**: MCP tools implementation
- **C**: CLI commands implementation
- **D**: Hybrid approach (recommended) — Instructions + MCP tools

User selected **Option D: Hybrid Approach**.

### Decision 11: Implement Session Automation Tools

**Rationale**: MCP tools provide programmatic automation that AI can call automatically based on trigger rules, while
enhanced instructions ensure consistent behavior.

**Actions**:

1. **Implemented 3 MCP Tools** in `src/sage/services/mcp_server.py`:

| Tool             | Purpose                    | Parameters                              |
|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `session_start`  | Create session state file  | `task`, `description`, `autonomy_level` |
| `session_end`    | End session, create record | `summary`, `next_steps`, `record_type`  |
| `session_status` | Check active sessions      | (none)                                  |

2. **Updated `list_tools()`** to include `session_tools` category

3. **Updated server startup message** to list session tools

4. **Added trigger rules** to `.junie/GUIDELINES.md`:
    - Session Automation section with tool descriptions
    - Automatic trigger rules table (6 conditions)
    - Usage examples

### Implementation Details

**Tool Behavior**:

- `session_start`: Creates `.history/current/session-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` with task state template
- `session_end`:
    - Auto-detects record type (conversation vs handoff) based on `next_steps`
    - Creates record in `.history/conversations/` or `.history/handoffs/`
    - Removes session state file after completion
- `session_status`: Returns active sessions and recent records

**Trigger Rules Added**:

| Trigger             | Action                                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Complex task begins | `session_status()` → `session_start()`   |
| Work completed      | `session_end(summary)`                   |
| Work interrupted    | `session_end(summary, next_steps="...")` |
| Resuming work       | `session_status()`                       |

### Files Changed

| File                              | Action   | Changes                         |
|-----------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| `src/sage/services/mcp_server.py` | Modified | +329 lines (3 tools + category) |
| `.junie/GUIDELINES.md`            | Modified | +36 lines (automation section)  |

### Learnings (Iteration 7)

1. **Tool-Based Automation**: MCP tools provide a middle ground between manual workflows and full automation - AI can
   call them based on rules without requiring complex event systems.

2. **Auto-Detection Pattern**: The `session_end` tool's auto-detection of record type (based on whether `next_steps` is
   provided) reduces decision burden while maintaining flexibility.

3. **Incremental Automation**: Phase 1 (semi-automated with tools) can be implemented quickly; full automation (Phase
   2-3 with EventBus integration) can be added later.

## Session Continuation 8: Documentation Quality Automation

### Context

User asked "如何能更自动化文档质量维护" (How to automate documentation quality maintenance more effectively) and
accepted all proposed automation recommendations.

### Analysis

**Existing Capabilities (Underutilized)**:

- `QualityAnalyzer` in `src/sage/capabilities/analyzers/quality.py` — Markdown quality scoring
- `LinkChecker` in `src/sage/capabilities/checkers/links.py` — Internal link validation
- `validate` CLI command — Only checked directory structure
- Pre-commit config — Only had doc8 for line length

**Gap Identified**: Powerful analyzers existed but weren't integrated into development workflow.

### Implementation (5 Phases)

#### Phase 1: Enhanced CLI `validate` Command

**File**: `src/sage/services/cli.py` (+130 lines)

**New Options**:
| Option | Default | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `--links/--no-links` | True | Enable/disable link checking |
| `--quality/--no-quality` | True | Enable/disable quality analysis |
| `--min-score` | 70 | Minimum quality score threshold |

**Features Added**:

- Integrated `LinkChecker` with detailed broken link reporting
- Integrated `QualityAnalyzer` with score display
- Progress spinners for long operations
- Organized output into 3 phases: Structure, Links, Quality

#### Phase 2: DocumentationChecker Class

**File**: `src/sage/capabilities/checkers/documentation.py` (550 lines, new)

**Rules Implemented**:

| Rule       | Description                       | Severity     |
|------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| FORMAT-001 | H1 title required                 | Error        |
| FORMAT-002 | TOC required (>60 lines or >3 H2) | Warning      |
| FORMAT-003 | H2 numbering check                | Info         |
| STRUCT-001 | Related section required          | Warning      |
| STRUCT-002 | SAGE footer required              | Info         |
| METRIC-001 | Lines per file (<300)             | Info         |
| METRIC-002 | Nesting depth (≤4)                | Warning      |
| METRIC-003 | H2 count (5-15 recommended)       | Info         |
| METRIC-004 | Related links count (3-5)         | Info         |
| NAMING-001 | File naming convention            | Info/Warning |

**Classes**: `Severity`, `DocIssue`, `DocReport`, `DocumentationChecker`
**Entry Point**: `python -m sage.capabilities.checkers.documentation` for pre-commit

#### Phase 3: Pre-commit Hooks

**File**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (+24 lines)

**New Hooks**:
| Hook | Stage | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `sage-doc-quality` | pre-commit | Check documentation_standards compliance |
| `sage-link-check` | pre-push | Validate internal links (slower) |

**Supporting Script**: `tools/check_links.py` (85 lines, new)

#### Phase 4: CI/CD Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/doc-quality.yml` (233 lines, new)

**Jobs**:
| Job | Trigger | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `validate` | push/PR | Structure, links, quality, standards checks |
| `report` | PR only | Generate quality report summary |
| `metrics` | main push | Collect metrics for tracking |

**Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop when .knowledge/docs/.context changes

#### Phase 5: Index Maintainer Tool

**File**: `tools/index_maintainer.py` (415 lines, new)

**Commands**:

```bash
python tools/index_maintainer.py validate  # Check for issues
python tools/index_maintainer.py update    # Fix auto-fixable issues
python tools/index_maintainer.py report    # Generate detailed report
```
**Features**:

- Validates file counts in index tables
- Detects broken internal references
- Auto-fixes count mismatches
- Generates markdown reports

### Files Created/Modified

| File                                              | Action   | Lines |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|
| `src/sage/services/cli.py`                        | Modified | +130  |
| `src/sage/capabilities/checkers/documentation.py` | Created  | 550   |
| `src/sage/capabilities/checkers/__init__.py`      | Modified | +15   |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml`                         | Modified | +24   |
| `tools/check_links.py`                            | Created  | 85    |
| `.github/workflows/doc-quality.yml`               | Created  | 233   |
| `tools/index_maintainer.py`                       | Created  | 415   |

**Total New Code**: ~1,450 lines

### Usage Summary

```bash
# CLI validation (immediate use)
sage validate                      # Full validation
sage validate --no-links           # Skip link check
sage validate --min-score 80       # Higher quality threshold
# Pre-commit (automatic on commit/push)
pre-commit install
pre-commit run sage-doc-quality    # Manual run
# Index maintenance
python tools/index_maintainer.py validate
python tools/index_maintainer.py update
# CI/CD (automatic on push/PR)
# Triggers on .knowledge/docs/.context changes
```
### Learnings (Iteration 8)

1. **Capability Integration**: Existing analyzers/checkers were powerful but isolated. Integration into
   CLI/pre-commit/CI made them actionable.

2. **Layered Automation**:
    - Layer 1: CLI for manual checks
    - Layer 2: Pre-commit for local automation
    - Layer 3: CI/CD for team-wide enforcement

3. **Rule Codification**: documentation_standards rules translated into code provide consistent, automated enforcement.

4. **Progressive Strictness**: Using severity levels (Error/Warning/Info) allows gradual adoption without blocking
   workflow.
