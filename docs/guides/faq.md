## General

### What is SAGE?

SAGE (Smart AI-Guided Expertise) is a knowledge management system designed for AI-human collaboration. It provides structured knowledge through CLI, MCP server, and Python API.

### What does SAGE stand for?

SAGE represents the protocol flow:
- **S**ource — Knowledge sourcing and loading
- **A**nalyze — Processing and analysis
- **G**enerate — Multi-channel output
- **E**volve — Metrics and optimization

### Who should use SAGE?

- AI assistants needing structured knowledge
- Developers wanting organized documentation
- Teams building AI-enhanced workflows
- Projects requiring knowledge management

---

## Installation

### What Python version is required?

Python 3.12 or higher is required.

### How do I install SAGE?

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install sage-kb

# With MCP support
pip install sage-kb[mcp]

# Development installation
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Why can't I find the `sage` command?

Ensure the installation directory is in your PATH:

```bash
# Check where pip installs scripts
pip show sage-kb | grep Location

# Add to PATH if needed
export PATH="$PATH:$(python -m site --user-base)/bin"
```

---

## CLI Usage

### How do I get knowledge?

```bash
# Get core principles
sage get core

# Get specific layer
sage get --layer guidelines

# Search knowledge
sage search "timeout"
```

### What layers are available?

| Layer | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `core` | Core principles and defaults |
| `guidelines` | Practical guidelines |
| `frameworks` | Conceptual frameworks |
| `practices` | Implementation practices |

### How do I see system info?

```bash
sage info
sage info --verbose
```

---

## MCP Integration

### How do I start the MCP server?

```bash
# Start with stdio (for AI clients)
sage serve

# Start with specific transport
sage serve --transport sse --port 3000
```

### How do I configure Claude Desktop?

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sage": {
      "command": "sage",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### What MCP tools are available?

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_knowledge` | Retrieve knowledge by layer |
| `search_knowledge` | Search knowledge base |
| `kb_info` | Get system information |
| `get_framework` | Get specific framework |

### Why isn't my AI client seeing SAGE tools?

1. Verify server is running: `sage serve --verbose`
2. Check client configuration
3. Restart the AI client
4. Check logs for errors

---

## Configuration

### Where is the configuration file?

Main configuration is at `config/sage.yaml`. Environment-specific overrides can use environment variables.

### How do I override configuration?

```bash
# Environment variables
export SAGE_TIMEOUT_CACHE_LOOKUP=200ms
export SAGE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Custom config file
sage --config custom.yaml get core
```

### What are the timeout levels?

| Level | Timeout | Scope |
|-------|---------|-------|
| T1 | 100ms | Cache lookup |
| T2 | 500ms | Single file |
| T3 | 2s | Layer load |
| T4 | 5s | Full KB load |
| T5 | 10s | Complex analysis |

---

## Performance

### Why is SAGE slow to start?

Try these optimizations:

1. Enable lazy loading in config
2. Reduce preloaded layers
3. Check disk I/O performance
4. Profile with `sage --profile info`

### How do I improve response times?

1. Use appropriate timeout levels
2. Enable caching
3. Limit result sizes with `--max-results`
4. Use layer-specific queries instead of full search

### What is the recommended token budget?

Default is 4000 tokens. Adjust based on your use case:

```yaml
token_budget:
  default: 4000
  layers:
    core: 500
    guidelines: 1000
```

---

## Development

### How do I run tests?

```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=sage

# Specific category
pytest tests/unit/
```

### How do I create a plugin?

See the [Plugin Development Guide](plugin_development.md) for detailed instructions.

Quick start:
```python
from sage.plugins import PluginBase, hookimpl

class MyPlugin(PluginBase):
    name = "my-plugin"
    
    @hookimpl
    def register_tools(self, registry):
        registry.add_tool(self.my_tool)
```

### How do I contribute?

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes with tests
4. Run `pytest` and `ruff check`
5. Submit a pull request

### Where do I report bugs?

Open an issue on GitHub:
https://github.com/HengYangDS/sage-kb/issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Command not found | Check PATH, reinstall |
| Import error | Install with all dependencies |
| Timeout errors | Increase timeout in config |
| MCP not connecting | Check server, restart client |

### Getting Help

1. Check [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)
2. Search existing issues
3. Ask in discussions
4. Open a new issue with details

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable maximum logging
sage --debug get core

# With timing information
sage --debug --timing get core
```
