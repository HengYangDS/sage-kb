## 3. Capability Families (MECE)

| Family | Responsibility | Key Question |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **analyzers** | Analysis, diagnosis, graph | What is it? |
| **checkers** | Check, validate, verify | Is it correct? |
| **monitors** | Monitor, observe, alert | What's happening? |
| **converters** | Convert, migrate, adapt | How to transform? |
| **generators** | Generate, build, create | How to produce? |
