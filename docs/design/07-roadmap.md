# Implementation Roadmap

> **Structure reorganization + feature enhancement + modern tooling**

## Overview

- **Target**: Production-ready MVP
- **Duration**: 18-21 days (3-4 weeks)
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows (PowerShell) + macOS/Linux (Bash)

---

## 7.0 Resource Requirements & Assumptions

### 7.0.1 Team Composition (Recommended)

| Role                  | FTE     | Responsibilities                               |
|-----------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Lead Developer**    | 1.0     | Architecture, core implementation, code review |
| **Backend Developer** | 0.5-1.0 | Services, API, testing                         |
| **DevOps**            | 0.25    | CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure              |
| **Technical Writer**  | 0.25    | Documentation, examples                        |

**Minimum Viable Team**: 1 full-stack developer (all phases take 2x longer)

### 7.0.2 Critical Path Analysis

```
Critical Path (must be sequential):
A.3-A.6 → B.1-B.4 → C.1-C.4 → G.1-G.3 → H.1-H.3
   ↓
  [Core Architecture] → [Logging] → [Events] → [Memory]

Parallelizable:
- Phase D (Tools) can run parallel to Phase C
- Phase E (Tests) can run parallel to Phase D
- Phase F (Enhancement) can run parallel to Phase E
- Documentation can be continuous throughout
```

### 7.0.3 Risk Factors

| Risk                          | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                    |
|-------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Async complexity in EventBus  | Medium      | High   | Add 2 extra days buffer       |
| Memory persistence edge cases | Medium      | Medium | Comprehensive test fixtures   |
| Cross-platform path issues    | Low         | Medium | Early Windows testing         |
| Dependency conflicts          | Low         | High   | Lock versions in requirements |

## 7.1 Current Project Status Assessment

> ⚠️ **Implementation Gap Notice**
>
> This roadmap bridges the gap between the **current implementation** and the **target architecture**.
> - **Current**: Package `ai_collab_kb`, config file `aikb.yaml`
> - **Target**: Package `sage`, config file `sage.yaml`
>
> Many features documented in the design (DI Container, EventBus, structured logging) are not yet implemented.
> This roadmap provides the path to achieve the target architecture defined in `01-architecture.md`.

|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Path separators**       | Use `pathlib.Path` instead of string concatenation |
| **Environment variables** | Use `os.environ.get()` with defaults               |
| **Shell commands**        | Provide both Bash and PowerShell variants          |
| **Line endings**          | Configure `.gitattributes` for consistent handling |
| **Task runner**           | Use `just` (cross-platform) alongside `Makefile`   |
