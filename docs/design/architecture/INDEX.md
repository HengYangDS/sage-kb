## 1. Overview

This directory documents the architectural foundations of SAGE, including layer structure, dependencies, and infrastructure.

## 4. Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Layered** | Clear separation of concerns |
| **Pluggable** | Extension via plugin system |
| **Configurable** | Flexible configuration |
| **Resilient** | Timeout and fault tolerance |
