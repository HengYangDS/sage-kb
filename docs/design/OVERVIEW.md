# SAGE Design Overview

> Comprehensive design documentation for SAGE Knowledge Base system

## 1. What is SAGE?

SAGE (Source, Analyze, Generate, Evolve) is an intelligent knowledge management system that:

- **Sources** knowledge from multiple inputs
- **Analyzes** and structures information
- **Generates** multi-channel outputs
- **Evolves** through continuous improvement

## 2. Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **信 (Faithfulness)** | Accurate representation of knowledge |
| **达 (Expressiveness)** | Clear and effective communication |
| **雅 (Elegance)** | Refined and maintainable design |

## 3. Architecture Layers

    Core["Core Engine (DI, Events, Models)"]
    Plugins["Plugins (Extension mechanisms)"]
    
    Services --> Capabilities --> Core --> Plugins
```

## 6. Reading Order

For new readers, recommended order:

1. **Philosophy** → Understand the "why"
2. **Protocols** → Learn the core patterns
3. **Architecture** → See the big picture
4. **Core Engine** → Dive into internals
5. **Services** → Understand interfaces
6. **Capabilities** → Explore extensibility
