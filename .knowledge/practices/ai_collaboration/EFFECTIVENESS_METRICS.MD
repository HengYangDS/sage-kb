## 1. Key Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|:-------|:--------|:-------|
| Token Efficiency | Output value / Tokens used | High |
| Task Completion Rate | Completed / Attempted | >90% |
| Iteration Count | Rounds to completion | <5 |
| Time to First Value | Minutes to useful output | <10 |

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Measure | Target |
|:-------|:--------|:-------|
| First-time Accuracy | Correct without revision | >80% |
| Code Quality | Lint/test pass rate | >95% |
| Documentation Coverage | Docs per feature | 100% |

### Session Tracking

```markdown
## Session Log: [DATE]
- Tokens used: [estimate]
- Tasks completed: [count]
- Iterations needed: [count]
- Blockers hit: [list]
```

### Weekly Review

| Question | Answer |
|:---------|:-------|
| Most efficient task type? | [type] |
| Biggest token waste? | [cause] |
| Improvement opportunity? | [action] |

## 3. Benchmarks

| Task Type | Token Budget | Iterations | Time |
|:----------|:-------------|:-----------|:-----|
| Bug fix | 500-1000 | 1-2 | 5-10min |
| New feature | 2000-5000 | 3-5 | 30-60min |
| Refactoring | 1500-3000 | 2-4 | 20-40min |

## 4. Improvement Actions

| Issue | Action |
|:------|:-------|
| High token usage | Use tiered loading |
| Many iterations | Clearer initial spec |
| Low accuracy | Add context/examples |
| Slow start | Use scenario presets |
