## 1. Xin-Da-Ya Success Mapping

| Principle        | Success Indicator            | Failure Sign              |
|------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **信 (Faithful)** | Works correctly, tests pass  | Bugs, incorrect behavior  |
| **达 (Clear)**    | Easy to understand, maintain | Confusing, hard to modify |
| **雅 (Elegant)**  | Simple, minimal complexity   | Over-engineered, bloated  |

### 1.1 Priority Application

```text
信 (Correct) → 达 (Clear) → 雅 (Elegant)
```
Never sacrifice correctness for elegance.
