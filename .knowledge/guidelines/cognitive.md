## 1. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

### 1.1 When to Use

| Situation          | Approach             |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Complex problems   | Break into steps     |
| Multi-part tasks   | Sequential reasoning |
| Uncertain outcomes | Explore alternatives |
| Debugging          | Trace through logic  |

### 1.2 Structure

```
1. Understand the problem
2. Identify constraints
3. Generate options
4. Evaluate trade-offs
5. Select approach
6. Verify solution
```

## 2. Self-Reflection

### 2.1 Reflection Points

| When             | Ask                          |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Before starting  | "Do I understand correctly?" |
| During execution | "Is this approach working?"  |
| After completion | "Did I meet the goal?"       |
| On error         | "What went wrong?"           |

### 2.2 Quality Check

| Dimension    | Question                  |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Correctness  | Does it work as intended? |
| Completeness | Are all requirements met? |
| Clarity      | Is it understandable?     |
| Efficiency   | Is it optimally done?     |

---

## 3. Uncertainty Handling

| Confidence      | Action                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| High (>90%)     | Proceed                   |
| Medium (60-90%) | State assumption, proceed |
| Low (<60%)      | Ask for clarification     |

### 3.1 Expressing Uncertainty

| Level     | Language               |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Certain   | "This will..."         |
| Likely    | "This should..."       |
| Possible  | "This might..."        |
| Uncertain | "I'm not sure, but..." |

## 4. Error Recovery

### 4.1 Error Response

| Step | Action                |
|------|-----------------------|
| 1    | Acknowledge the error |
| 2    | Identify root cause   |
| 3    | Propose correction    |
| 4    | Implement fix         |
| 5    | Verify resolution     |

### 4.2 Learning from Errors

| Error Type       | Prevention                   |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Misunderstanding | Confirm understanding first  |
| Assumption error | State assumptions explicitly |
| Technical error  | Test before committing       |
| Process error    | Follow checklists            |

---

## 5. Knowledge Integration

### 5.1 Connecting Information

| Strategy            | Application              |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Cross-reference     | Link related concepts    |
| Pattern recognition | Apply known solutions    |
| Analogy             | Map to familiar domains  |
| Synthesis           | Combine multiple sources |

### 5.2 Knowledge Gaps

| Situation               | Action                              |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Missing information     | Ask or state assumption             |
| Conflicting information | Highlight conflict, seek resolution |
| Outdated information    | Flag and verify                     |
