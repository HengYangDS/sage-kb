## 1. Scope & Boundaries

| Layer | Focus | Contains | Example |
|:------|:------|:---------|:--------|
| **Guidelines** | "What rules" | Standards, principles, conventions | Code style rules |
| **Practices** | "How to do" | Procedures, workflows, operations | Step-by-step testing guide |

**When to use which**:
- Need a rule/standard? → Guidelines
- Need implementation steps? → Practices
- Guidelines reference practices for details
- Practices implement guidelines
