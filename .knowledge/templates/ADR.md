## Instructions

### 1. Numbering

Use sequential 4-digit numbers: `ADR-0001`, `ADR-0002`, etc.

### 2. Status Lifecycle

| Status         | Meaning                 |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Proposed**   | Under discussion        |
| **Accepted**   | Approved and active     |
| **Deprecated** | No longer recommended   |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by another ADR |

### 3. Best Practices

| Practice          | Description                    |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Be concise        | Focus on key points            |
| Be specific       | Avoid vague language           |
| Include context   | Future readers need background |
| Link related ADRs | Maintain traceability          |
| Update status     | Keep lifecycle current         |

### 4. File Naming
