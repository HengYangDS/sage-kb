## Instructions

### 1. Postmortem Principles

| Principle      | Description                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Blameless**  | Focus on systems, not individuals |
| **Thorough**   | Document everything relevant      |
| **Actionable** | Every finding has an action item  |
| **Timely**     | Complete within 5 business days   |
| **Shared**     | Distribute learnings widely       |

### 2. When to Write

| Severity | Postmortem Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| SEV1     | Always              |
| SEV2     | Always              |
| SEV3     | If learning value   |
| SEV4     | Rarely              |

### 3. Timeline Best Practices

- Use UTC timestamps
- Be precise (HH:MM, not "around noon")
- Include all significant events
- Note communication points

### 4. Action Item Guidelines

| Quality  | Example                                                |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Good** | "Add alerting for database connection pool exhaustion" |
| **Bad**  | "Improve monitoring"                                   |
| **Good** | "Implement circuit breaker for payment service"        |
| **Bad**  | "Make service more reliable"                           |

### 5. Review Process

| Step                 | Timeline        |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Draft                | Within 48 hours |
| Team review          | Within 72 hours |
| Final approval       | Within 5 days   |
| Action item tracking | Ongoing         |
