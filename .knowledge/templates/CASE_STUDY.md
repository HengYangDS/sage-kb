### Problem

The `build_knowledge_graph` function was creating output files in the current working directory instead of the
designated `.outputs/` directory.

### Root Cause

The function directly used the provided `output_file` path without ensuring it was placed in the `.outputs/` directory.

### Solution

Modified `mcp_server.py` to:

1. Create `.outputs/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Extract only the filename from user-provided path
3. Construct output path as `.outputs/{filename}`
```python
# Before
builder.export_to_json(Path(output_file))

# After
outputs_dir = project_root / ".outputs"
outputs_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
output_path = outputs_dir / Path(output_file).name
builder.export_to_json(output_path)
```
### Lessons Learned

- Always normalize output paths to designated directories
- Create output directories programmatically
- Document output file locations in function docstrings
