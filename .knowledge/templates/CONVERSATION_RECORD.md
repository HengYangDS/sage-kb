## Instructions

1. **Naming**: Save as `YYYY-MM-DD-TOPIC.md` (e.g., `2025-11-29-TIMEOUT-DESIGN.md`)
2. **Location**: Store in `.history/conversations/`
3. **Timing**: Create during or immediately after significant sessions
4. **Focus**: Capture decisions and learnings, not verbatim transcripts
5. **Links**: Reference related code, docs, or handoffs

### What to Include

- Significant design decisions
- Problem-solving approaches that worked
- Insights about the codebase or architecture
- Lessons learned from debugging sessions
- Cross-cutting concerns discovered

### What to Omit

- Routine queries with obvious answers
- Minor formatting or typo fixes
- Information already documented elsewhere

# Timeout Architecture: Multi-tier Design Discussion
> **Date**: 2025-11-29
> **Participants**: Developer, Junie AI
> **Duration**: ~45 minutes
> **Status**: Completed
---
## Context
Designing the timeout hierarchy for MyProject to ensure responsive AI interactions while handling varying
content load times.
---
## Key Discussion Points
### Timeout Tier Structure
Discussed 5-tier approach from T1 (100ms cache) to T5 (10s complex analysis). Evaluated tradeoffs between responsiveness
and completeness.
### Fallback Strategies
Explored graceful degradation patterns when timeouts occur. Decided on partial content delivery over complete failure.
---
## Decisions Made
| Decision                         | Rationale                      | Impact                    |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 5-tier timeout hierarchy         | Balances speed vs completeness | Core architecture pattern |
| Partial content on T3/T4 timeout | Better UX than failure         | Affects all loaders       |
---
## Action Items
- [x] Document timeout hierarchy in `.context/policies/`
- [x] Implement TimeoutLoader base class
- [ ] Add timeout metrics to monitoring
---
## Learnings & Insights
### What Worked Well
- Breaking down by operation type clarified requirements
- Example scenarios helped validate tier boundaries
### Future Considerations
- May need T6 for batch operations
- Consider adaptive timeouts based on content size
