## 6. Incident Response

### Incident Classification

| Severity | Definition    | Response Time | Examples                             |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| P1       | Active breach | Immediate     | Data exfiltration, system compromise |
| P2       | High risk     | 1 hour        | Credential leak, vulnerability       |
| P3       | Medium risk   | 4 hours       | Failed attacks, suspicious activity  |
| P4       | Low risk      | 24 hours      | Policy violation, misconfiguration   |

### Response Flow

```
Detect → Assess → Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Learn
```
### Immediate Actions by Type
