## 3. Key Concepts

### 3.1 Expert Committee Pattern

Simulates a multi-expert review process with:

- **Architecture Group** (6 experts): System design, scalability
- **Knowledge Engineering Group** (6 experts): Content structure, taxonomy
- **AI Collaboration Group** (6 experts): Human-AI interaction patterns
- **Engineering Practice Group** (6 experts): Code quality, testing

### 3.2 Information Density

Optimizes knowledge representation for:

- Token efficiency (95%+ utilization)
- Context window management
- Semantic compression
