## 4. Application Process

### 4.1 Quick Evaluation (3 angles)

For simple decisions, check:

1. Correctness
2. Clarity
3. Maintainability

### 4.2 Standard Evaluation (Core 10)

For normal decisions, check all core angles.

### 4.3 Comprehensive Evaluation (25+)

For major decisions, check core + extended + domain angles.

### Core Angles

| Angle           | Score | Notes |
|-----------------|:-----:|-------|
| Correctness     |   ~   |       |
| Completeness    |   ~   |       |
| Consistency     |   ~   |       |
| Clarity         |   ~   |       |
| Maintainability |   ~   |       |
| Performance     |   ~   |       |
| Security        |   ~   |       |
| Reliability     |   ~   |       |
| Usability       |   ~   |       |
| Testability     |   ~   |       |

> Score: ✓ = Pass | ✗ = Fail | ~ = Needs Review

## 6. Coverage Matrix

| Evaluation Type | Angles | Coverage |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Quick           | 3      | 70%      |
| Core            | 10     | 85%      |
| Extended        | 15     | 95%      |
| Domain          | 10+    | 100%     |

**Golden Rule**: Start with core 10, add extended/domain as needed.
