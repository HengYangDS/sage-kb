## 1. Daily Workflow

| Phase     | Actions                                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| **Start** | Load context, set autonomy, define goals |
| **Work**  | Execute tasks, checkpoint progress       |
| **End**   | Summarize, document decisions, handoff   |

## 2. Task Workflow

### 2.1 Task Start

| Step | Action                   |
|------|--------------------------|
| 1    | Define goal clearly      |
| 2    | Set autonomy level       |
| 3    | Provide constraints      |
| 4    | Reference relevant files |

### 2.2 During Task

| Step | Action                    |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1    | Monitor progress          |
| 2    | Provide feedback          |
| 3    | Checkpoint on milestones  |
| 4    | Adjust autonomy if needed |

### 2.3 Task End

| Step | Action             |
|------|--------------------|
| 1    | Verify completion  |
| 2    | Review changes     |
| 3    | Document decisions |
| 4    | Update calibration |

## 3. Session Management

### 3.1 New Session

```markdown
## Context

- Previous: [summary of last session]
- Goal: [today's objective]
- Autonomy: L[X]

## Constraints

- [List any constraints]
```

### 3.2 Session Handoff

```markdown
## Session Summary

- Completed: [what was done]
- Decisions: [key choices]
- Pending: [what's next]
- Issues: [any blockers]
```

## 4. Communication Patterns

### 4.1 Effective Requests

| Type        | Format      |
|-------------|-------------|
| Direct      | "Do X"      |
| Goal-based  | "Achieve Y" |
| Exploratory | "Analyze Z" |
| Iterative   | "Improve W" |

### 4.2 Feedback Types

| Type          | When      | Example          |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| Approval      | Correct   | "Good, continue" |
| Correction    | Wrong     | "Change X to Y"  |
| Clarification | Unclear   | "What about Z?"  |
| Redirect      | Off-track | "Focus on A"     |

---

## 5. Error Recovery

| Situation        | Response             |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Misunderstanding | Clarify, retry       |
| Wrong approach   | Reset, new direction |
| Partial failure  | Salvage, complete    |
| Complete failure | Analyze, restart     |

---

## 6. Best Practices

| Practice            | Benefit             |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Clear goals         | Aligned execution   |
| Set autonomy        | Right balance       |
| Regular checkpoints | Catch issues early  |
| Document decisions  | Preserve knowledge  |
| Provide feedback    | Improve calibration |
