## Overview

This framework provides structured quality evaluation through multiple angles, organized in three layers following the Taoist principle: "One generates Two, Two generates Three, Three generates All Things."

---

## Three-Layer Quality Structure

```
One (Core Layer):     10 fundamental quality dimensions
    ↓
Two (Extended Layer): 15 specialized quality dimensions
    ↓
Three (Domain Layer): 10+ industry-specific dimensions
    ↓
All Things (∞):       Dynamic composition by scenario
```

**Theoretical Basis**: ISO/IEC 25010 Quality Model + Practical Extensions

## Integration with Expert Committee

Quality angles are evaluated by corresponding expert roles:

| Angle Category | Primary Expert | Secondary |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Functional | QA, Engineer | Product Manager |
| Architectural | Architect, Engineer | DevOps |
| Evolutionary | QA, DevOps | Architect |
| User Experience | UX Designer | Product Manager |
| Technical Depth | Performance Engineer | Architect |
