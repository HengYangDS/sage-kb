## Overview

This framework defines patterns for effective human-AI collaboration, including communication patterns, task handoff protocols, and instruction engineering principles.

---

## 1. Communication Patterns

### 1.1 Instruction Types

| Type | Description | Example | Best Practice |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Direct** | Explicit command | "Create user API endpoint" | Clear, specific, actionable |
| **Contextual** | Implied by context | Fixing similar bugs | Provide sufficient background |
| **Conditional** | With constraints | "Refactor only if tests pass" | State conditions clearly |
| **Exploratory** | Open-ended research | "Investigate performance issue" | Define scope and criteria |
| **Batch** | Multiple tasks | "Complete all TODO items" | Group related tasks |

### 1.2 Response Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Format |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Confirmation** | Before risky actions | "I will do X. Proceed?" |
| **Progress** | Long operations | "Step 2/5: Implementing..." |
| **Completion** | Task finished | "Done. Summary: ..." |
| **Clarification** | Ambiguous input | "Did you mean A or B?" |
| **Error** | On failure | "Error: X. Suggested fix: Y" |

### 1.3 Context Preservation

```markdown
## Session Context Template

### Project State
- Project: [name]
- Branch: [current branch]
- Recent changes: [summary]

### Current Task
- Objective: [what]
- Constraints: [limitations]
- Progress: [status]

### Relevant Files
- [file1]: [purpose]
- [file2]: [purpose]
```

---

## 2. Task Handoff Protocols

### 2.1 Simple Handoff

```
Human → AI: "Do X"
AI: [Confirms] → [Executes] → [Reports]
Human: [Reviews]
```

### 2.2 Detailed Handoff

```markdown
## Task: [Title]

### Requirements
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2

### Constraints
- Constraint 1
- Constraint 2

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

### Autonomy Level
[L1-L6]
```

### 2.3 Batch Handoff

```markdown
## Batch Tasks

### Tasks (Autonomy: L4)
1. Task 1 - [priority]
2. Task 2 - [priority]
3. Task 3 - [priority]

### Execution Order
Sequential / Parallel / Priority-based

### Checkpoint
After [N] tasks / [time] / [milestone]
```

## 3. Instruction Engineering

### 3.1 CLEAR Framework

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **C**ontext | Background information | "In this FastAPI project..." |
| **L**imitations | Constraints and boundaries | "Don't modify database schema" |
| **E**xpectations | Success criteria | "Tests should pass" |
| **A**ction | What to do | "Implement user auth" |
| **R**eview | Checkpoint requirements | "Show plan before coding" |

### 3.2 Instruction Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous objective
- [ ] **Scoped**: Boundaries defined
- [ ] **Measurable**: Success criteria stated
- [ ] **Contextual**: Relevant background provided
- [ ] **Prioritized**: Importance indicated

### 3.3 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Better Approach |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| "Make it better" | Vague, subjective | Specific improvement criteria |
| "Do everything" | Unbounded scope | Prioritized task list |
| "You know what I mean" | Assumes understanding | Explicit requirements |
| "ASAP" | No real deadline | Specific time constraint |
| "Don't mess up" | Negative framing | Positive success criteria |

---

## 4. Collaboration Modes

### 4.1 Mode Definitions

| Mode | Description | AI Behavior |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Plan** | Strategic planning | Create plan, await approval |
| **Execute** | Task execution | Run with progress updates |
| **Review** | Code/design review | Analyze without changes |
| **Explain** | Teaching/learning | Explain concepts clearly |
| **Debug** | Problem investigation | Diagnose with minimal changes |
| **Pair** | Collaborative work | Interactive back-and-forth |

### 4.2 Mode Selection Guide

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Complex new feature | Plan → Execute |
| Bug fix (clear cause) | Execute |
| Bug fix (unclear) | Debug → Execute |
| Code quality review | Review |
| Learning new tech | Explain |
| Refactoring | Plan → Execute |
| Quick changes | Execute |

---

## 5. Feedback Loops

### 5.1 Immediate Feedback

```
Action → Result → Adjustment
   ↑__________________|
```

- Correct misunderstandings immediately
- Provide specific feedback
- Acknowledge good work

### 5.2 Session Feedback

```markdown
## Session Feedback

### What Worked Well
- [positive pattern 1]
- [positive pattern 2]

### What Could Improve
- [improvement area 1]
- [improvement area 2]

### Autonomy Adjustment
Current: L[N] → Suggested: L[M]
Reason: [justification]
```

### 5.3 Calibration Signals

| Signal | Interpretation | Action |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| "Let me see first" | Decrease autonomy | Lower to L1-L2 |
| "You decide" | Increase autonomy | Raise to L3-L4 |
| "Explain your reasoning" | Show more detail | Verbose mode |
| "Just do it" | Less explanation | Concise mode |
| "Stop" | Pause execution | Checkpoint immediately |

---

## 6. Error Recovery Patterns

### 6.1 Error Classification

| Type | Severity | Recovery |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Syntax** | Low | Auto-fix |
| **Logic** | Medium | Report + suggest |
| **Data** | High | Stop + await guidance |
| **Security** | Critical | Stop immediately |

### 6.2 Recovery Protocol

```
1. Detect error
2. Classify severity
3. Stop if High/Critical
4. Document error clearly
5. Analyze root cause
6. Propose solution(s)
7. Await approval if needed
8. Execute fix
9. Verify resolution
```

### 6.3 Error Report Template

```markdown
## Error Report

**Type**: [classification]
**Severity**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
**Location**: [file:line]

### Description
[What happened]

### Root Cause
[Why it happened]

### Impact
[What was affected]

### Proposed Fix
[Solution]

### Prevention
[How to avoid in future]
```

## 7. Integration with Autonomy Levels

| Level | Communication | Checkpoints | Feedback |
|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **L1-L2** | Every step | After each action | Immediate |
| **L3-L4** | Major milestones | At decisions | Periodic |
| **L5-L6** | Completion only | On issues | Summary |

---

## Quick Reference

### Starting a Collaboration

1. State context clearly
2. Define objective specifically
3. Set autonomy level
4. Specify constraints
5. Indicate priority/deadline

### During Collaboration

- Monitor progress updates
- Respond to questions promptly
- Provide feedback at checkpoints
- Adjust autonomy as needed

### Ending a Collaboration

- Review deliverables
- Provide session feedback
- Update autonomy calibration
- Document decisions made
