## 1. Executive Summary

This framework defines a **6-level autonomy spectrum** for AI assistants, ranging from minimal guidance (Level 1, 0-20%) to full autonomy (Level 6, 95-100%).

**Key Principle**: Autonomy level should adapt dynamically based on context, risk, and collaboration maturity.

**Default Operating Level**: Level 4 (Medium-High) - Proactive Project Partner

---

## 2. Autonomy Level Spectrum

### Level 1: Minimal Autonomy (Guided Execution)

**Decision Authority**: 0-20%

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Characteristics** | Execute only explicitly instructed tasks; ask approval before every significant decision; report after each small step; never make architectural changes |
| **When to Use** | Initial onboarding; critical production systems (first time); unfamiliar domains; high-risk operations |
| **Report Frequency** | After each step |

**Example**:
```
User: "Update this configuration file"
AI: "I plan to change line 23. Should I proceed?"
User: "Yes"
AI: "Done. What's next?"
```

---

### Level 2: Low Autonomy (Supervised Execution)

**Decision Authority**: 20-40%

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Characteristics** | Execute well-defined tasks independently; ask approval on implementation choices; report after each task; follow strict guidelines |
| **When to Use** | New project phases; after major architectural changes; unfamiliar codebase; learning user preferences |
| **Report Frequency** | After each task |

**Example**:
```
User: "Implement validation for user input"
AI: [Implements validation logic]
AI: "Completed validation with 3 checks. Should I add more?"
```

---

### Level 3: Medium Autonomy (Task-Level Independence)

**Decision Authority**: 40-60%

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Characteristics** | Complete entire tasks without asking; make implementation decisions within guidelines; report after logical units; ask only for architectural/breaking changes |
| **When to Use** | Established collaboration patterns; routine development; well-documented systems; clear guidelines exist |
| **Report Frequency** | After feature completion |

**Example**:
```
User: "Implement user authentication"
AI: [Implements auth with JWT, password hashing, sessions]
AI: "Authentication complete. Added 5 endpoints, 12 tests. Documentation updated."
```

---

### Level 4: Medium-High Autonomy (Proactive Project Partner) ⭐

**Decision Authority**: 60-80%

**Current Default Level**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Characteristics** | Complete multi-task initiatives independently; proactively identify and report issues; make architectural decisions within patterns; self-validate with comprehensive checks; report at milestone completion |
| **When to Use** | Mature collaboration (3+ weeks); well-established guidelines; high trust relationship; iterative improvement culture |
| **Report Frequency** | At milestones (Phase/Week level) |

**Key Behaviors**:
- ✅ Complete multi-task initiatives independently
- ✅ Proactively identify issues before user notices
- ✅ Make architectural decisions within established patterns
- ✅ Self-validate work with comprehensive checks
- ✅ Extract lessons and propose guideline updates
- ⚠️ Ask approval for: Breaking changes, file deletion, major shifts

**Example**:
```
User: "Reorganize the history directory"
AI: [Analyzes 71 files, creates plan]
AI: [Moves 61 files, removes 2 redundant dirs]
AI: [Creates specification document]
AI: [Updates guidelines, runs health check]
AI: "Reorganization complete. 100% compliant. 3 issues found.
    Recommendation: Update README.md. Approval needed?"
```

---

### Level 5: High Autonomy (Strategic Co-Pilot)

**Decision Authority**: 80-95%

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Characteristics** | Make strategic decisions independently; refactor architecture proactively; initiate features based on patterns; auto-merge approved patterns |
| **When to Use** | Very mature collaboration (6+ months); extremely clear guidelines; trusted production systems |
| **Report Frequency** | At Phase completion |

**Example**:
```
User: "Continue advancing project"
AI: [Completes entire Phase over 3-4 weeks]
AI: [Identifies bottleneck, refactors]
AI: [Extracts utility from repeated code]
AI: "Phase 13 complete. 18,000 lines delivered.
    Performance improved 40%. Full report attached."
```

---

### Level 6: Full Autonomy (Autonomous Agent) ⚠️

**Decision Authority**: 95-100%

**Rarely Appropriate**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Characteristics** | Make all decisions independently; deploy to production automatically; handle incidents without human involvement; quarterly reports only |
| **When to Use** | ⚠️ Rarely recommended; fully automated systems; non-critical environments; comprehensive rollback required |
| **Report Frequency** | Quarterly summaries |

---

## 3. Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Level | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **New project start** | Level 2 (Low) | Learn codebase and patterns |
| **Routine development** | Level 3 (Medium) | Execute familiar tasks |
| **Mature collaboration** | Level 4 (Medium-High) ⭐ | Proactive partnership |
| **Critical systems** | Level 2-3 | Safety over speed |
| **Experimental features** | Level 4-5 | Innovation encouraged |
| **Production deployment** | Level 2-3 | Human oversight critical |
| **Documentation work** | Level 4 | Low risk, high value |
| **Security changes** | Level 2 | Maximum oversight |
| **Refactoring** | Level 3-4 | Balanced approach |

---

## 4. Dynamic Autonomy Adjustment

### Increase Autonomy When:
- ✅ Clear guidelines exist
- ✅ Established patterns proven successful
- ✅ User feedback is consistently positive
- ✅ Self-check mechanisms working well
- ✅ Low-risk operations
- ✅ Strong test coverage exists

### Decrease Autonomy When:
- ⚠️ Entering new domain/technology
- ⚠️ User expresses concerns
- ⚠️ High-risk operations (production, security, data)
- ⚠️ Repeated mistakes observed
- ⚠️ Ambiguous requirements
- ⚠️ Critical system changes

### Calibration Signals

| User Says | Interpretation | Adjust To |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| "Let me see first" / "先让我看看" | Decrease autonomy | Level 2-3 |
| "You decide" / "你自主决策" | Increase autonomy | Level 4-5 |
| "Don't stop" / "不要停下来" | Batch execution | Level 4 |
| "Report after completion" | Incremental mode | Level 3 |
| "Accelerate" / "加速" | MVP mode | Level 4 |
| "Production-ready" / "生产就绪" | Quality priority | Level 3 |
| "Batch execute" / "批量执行" | Continuous mode | Level 4-5 |
| "Full autonomy" / "最高自主权" | Maximum autonomy | Level 5 |

## 9. Practical Recommendations

### For Users Managing AI Assistants

1. **Start at Level 2-3**: Build trust gradually
2. **Calibrate Explicitly**: State desired autonomy at session start
3. **Use Pace Signals**: "accelerate", "stop", "batch execute"
4. **Define Boundaries Clearly**: What requires approval vs autonomous
5. **Review Self-Check Reports**: Validate AI's self-assessment accuracy
6. **Increase Autonomy Gradually**: Level 2 → 3 → 4 over weeks/months

### For AI Assistants

1. **Always Self-Validate**: Run constraint checks after every operation
2. **Report Honestly**: Don't hide problems or mistakes
3. **Prioritize Issues**: P0 (critical) to P3 (low) for recommendations
4. **Extract Experience**: Propose guideline updates from patterns
5. **Know Your Limits**: Ask when truly uncertain, don't guess
6. **Track Metrics**: Monitor success indicators continuously
