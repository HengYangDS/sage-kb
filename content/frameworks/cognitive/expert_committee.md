## 1. Framework Overview

### 1.1 Design Philosophy

**Taoist Mapping**:
```
One (Taiji):     Decision essence = Quality × Efficiency
Two (Yin-Yang):  Expert dimension + Quality dimension
Three (Sancai):  Core layer + Extended layer + Domain layer
All Things (∞):  Dynamic composition = Infinite configurations
```

### 1.2 Core Principles

1. **Minimal Overlap**: Role responsibilities are mutually exclusive, angle definitions are clear
2. **Dynamic Composition**: Activate on demand, extend flexibly
3. **Ladder Progression**: From simple to complex, progressively enhance
4. **Cost-Benefit Balance**: Balance quality with efficiency

## 6. Dynamic Activation Algorithm

### 6.1 Auto-Classification Formula

```python
def determine_level(scenario):
    impact_score = calculate_impact(scenario.code_lines, scenario.users, scenario.modules)
    complexity_score = calculate_complexity(scenario.tech_stack, scenario.dependencies)
    risk_score = calculate_risk(scenario.reversibility, scenario.business_impact)
    
    total_score = impact_score * 0.3 + complexity_score * 0.3 + risk_score * 0.4
    
    if total_score < 20: return Level.MICRO
    elif total_score < 40: return Level.RAPID
    elif total_score < 60: return Level.MAJOR
    elif total_score < 80: return Level.STRATEGIC
    else: return Level.TRANSFORMATIVE
```

### 6.2 Dynamic Scaling

**Scale Up When**:
1. New risks discovered during deliberation
2. Knowledge gap identified (no expert coverage)
3. Consensus cannot be reached
4. Stakeholder requests additional review

**Scale Down When**:
1. Clear consensus reached early
2. Problem simpler than anticipated
3. Strong precedent exists
4. Time constraints require focused analysis
