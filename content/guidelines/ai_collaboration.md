## 6.1 Instruction Types

### Classification Matrix
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | Explicit command | "Create a user registration endpoint" |
| **Contextual** | Implied by context | Fixing similar bugs as previously discussed |
| **Conditional** | With constraints | "Refactor only if tests pass" |
| **Exploratory** | Open-ended research | "Investigate performance bottleneck" |

### Instruction Quality Checklist
- [ ] Clear objective stated
- [ ] Scope boundaries defined
- [ ] Success criteria specified
- [ ] Constraints identified
- [ ] Priority indicated

## 6.2 Autonomy Levels

> **Reference**: See `content/frameworks/autonomy/levels.md` for full 6-level autonomy framework

### Level Definitions
```
L1: Minimal (0-20%)      ← Execute only explicit tasks, ask before every decision
L2: Low (20-40%)         ← Execute well-defined tasks, ask on implementation choices
L3: Medium (40-60%)      ← Complete tasks independently, ask for architectural changes
L4: Medium-High (60-80%) ← Proactive project partner, multi-task initiatives [DEFAULT]
L5: High (80-95%)        ← Strategic decisions, refactor architecture proactively
L6: Full (95-100%)       ← Autonomous agent, rarely recommended
```

### Level Selection Guide
| Scenario | Recommended Level |
|----------|-------------------|
| Critical production changes | L1-L2 |
| New feature development | L2-L3 |
| Bug fixes (well-understood) | L3-L4 |
| Routine refactoring | L3-L4 |
| Documentation updates | L4-L5 |
| Formatting/style fixes | L4-L5 |

### Autonomy Adjustment Signals
**Increase autonomy when:**
- Task is well-understood
- Similar tasks completed successfully
- Low risk of damage
- Clear rollback path exists

**Decrease autonomy when:**
- Task is novel or complex
- High-stakes changes
- Uncertainty about requirements
- Previous errors in similar tasks

## 6.3 Execution Modes

### Mode Descriptions
| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Plan** | Create plan, await approval | Complex tasks |
| **Execute** | Run with progress updates | Standard tasks |
| **Review** | Analyze without changes | Code review |
| **Explain** | Teach/explain concepts | Learning |
| **Debug** | Investigate issues | Troubleshooting |

### Execution Flow
```
[Plan Mode]
1. Analyze requirements
2. Create step-by-step plan
3. Identify risks and dependencies
4. Present plan for approval
5. Wait for human confirmation

[Execute Mode]
1. Confirm understanding
2. Execute step by step
3. Report progress at checkpoints
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Summarize results
```

## 6.4 Communication Patterns

### Status Updates
```markdown
## Progress Update

**Status**: In Progress (3/5 steps complete)

### Completed
- [x] Created database migration
- [x] Updated model schema
- [x] Added API endpoint

### In Progress
- [ ] Writing unit tests

### Remaining
- [ ] Update documentation

**Blockers**: None
**ETA**: 15 minutes
```

### Error Reporting
```markdown
## Error Report

**Type**: Test Failure
**Location**: tests/test_user.py::test_create_user
**Severity**: Medium

### Description
User creation test fails due to missing email validation.

### Root Cause
Email validator not imported in user model.

### Proposed Fix
Add `from validators import validate_email` to models/user.py

### Action Required
- [ ] Approve fix
- [ ] Request alternative approach
- [ ] Provide additional context
```

## 6.5 Default Behaviors

### Standard Defaults
| Behavior | Default | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Autonomy Level | L2 (Guided) | Balance control and efficiency |
| Error Handling | Stop and report | Prevent cascading errors |
| Scope Expansion | Ask first | Avoid scope creep |
| Assumptions | State explicitly | Ensure alignment |
| Testing | Run affected tests | Verify changes |

### Override Syntax
```
# Temporarily increase autonomy
[L4] Complete all formatting fixes in src/

# Set specific mode
[MODE:REVIEW] Check this PR for security issues

# Conditional execution
[IF tests pass] Merge to develop branch
```

---

## 6.6 Collaboration Anti-Patterns

### Patterns to Avoid
| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Better Approach |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| Vague instructions | Misaligned execution | Be specific about goals |
| No success criteria | Unknown completion | Define "done" clearly |
| Implicit scope | Over/under delivery | Explicit boundaries |
| Ignoring warnings | Cascading errors | Address concerns |
| Micro-management | Inefficient, frustrating | Trust appropriate autonomy |

---

## 6.7 Calibration Signals

### Positive Signals (Working Well)
- Tasks completed as expected
- Few clarification questions needed
- Results match intent
- Efficient execution time

### Negative Signals (Adjustment Needed)
- Frequent misunderstandings
- Unexpected changes
- Missed requirements
- Excessive back-and-forth

### Calibration Actions
```
Signal: AI making too many assumptions
Action: Lower autonomy, increase checkpoints

Signal: AI asking too many questions
Action: Provide more context upfront, raise autonomy

Signal: Results consistently good
Action: Consider higher autonomy for similar tasks

Signal: Repeated similar errors
Action: Update guidelines, add specific rules
```

---

## 6.8 Quick Reference Card

### Starting a Task
1. State objective clearly
2. Define scope boundaries
3. Specify autonomy level (or use default L2)
4. Indicate priority and deadline
5. Mention any constraints

### During Execution
- Monitor progress updates
- Respond to questions promptly
- Approve/reject at checkpoints
- Provide feedback on approach

### After Completion
- Review results
- Provide feedback
- Update autonomy calibration
- Document learnings
