## 8.1 Quality Dimensions

### The Quality Triangle
```
        Correctness
           /\
          /  \
         /    \
        /      \
       /________\
Maintainability  Performance
```

### Quality Metrics
| Dimension | Metrics | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Correctness** | Test coverage, bug rate | >80% coverage, <1 bug/KLOC |
| **Maintainability** | Cyclomatic complexity, duplication | <10 complexity, <3% duplication |
| **Performance** | Response time, throughput | <200ms P95, >1000 RPS |
| **Security** | Vulnerability count, audit score | 0 critical, >90% score |
| **Reliability** | Uptime, MTTR | >99.9%, <15min MTTR |

## 8.2 Code Review Standards

### Review Checklist
```markdown
## Code Review Checklist

### Correctness
- [ ] Logic is correct and complete
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate

### Code Quality
- [ ] Follows style guidelines
- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] Names are clear and consistent

### Testing
- [ ] Tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] All tests pass

### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] No SQL injection risks

### Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs documented
- [ ] Complex logic explained
- [ ] README updated if needed
```

### Review Feedback Guidelines
| Type | Prefix | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Must fix | `[REQUIRED]` | Security vulnerability |
| Should fix | `[SUGGESTION]` | Better approach available |
| Nice to have | `[NIT]` | Minor style preference |
| Question | `[QUESTION]` | Seeking clarification |
| Praise | `[PRAISE]` | Well-done aspect |

## 8.3 Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Goals
| Test Type | Coverage Target | Focus |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Unit | >80% | Business logic |
| Integration | >60% | Component interactions |
| E2E | Critical paths | User journeys |

### Test Quality Criteria
```python
# GOOD: Clear, focused, maintainable test
def test_user_creation_with_valid_data_returns_user():
    # Arrange
    service = UserService(mock_repo)
    valid_data = {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}
    
    # Act
    result = service.create(valid_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.name == "Alice"
    assert result.email == "alice@example.com"
    assert mock_repo.save.called_once()

# BAD: Multiple concerns, unclear purpose
def test_user():
    # Tests creation, update, delete all in one
    # Hard to understand what's being tested
```

## 8.4 Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Gates
- [ ] Linting passes (no errors)
- [ ] Formatting correct
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Unit tests pass

### Pre-Merge Gates
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration)
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Pre-Release Gates
- [ ] E2E tests pass
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] Version bumped

## 8.5 Continuous Improvement

### Retrospective Questions
1. What went well?
2. What could be improved?
3. What will we try differently?

### Quality Debt Tracking
| Category | Example | Priority |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Technical | Missing tests | Medium |
| Documentation | Outdated README | Low |
| Security | Unpatched dependency | High |
| Performance | Slow query | Medium |

### Improvement Metrics
```
Track over time:
- Defect escape rate (bugs found in production)
- Mean time to resolution
- Code review turnaround time
- Test coverage trend
- Technical debt ratio
```

## 8.6 Quality Culture

### Principles
1. **Quality is everyone's responsibility**
2. **Prevention over detection**
3. **Continuous improvement**
4. **Measure what matters**
5. **Celebrate quality wins**

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Better Approach |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| "Ship and fix" | Quality debt accumulates | Build quality in from start |
| "Not my code" | Ownership gaps | Collective ownership |
| "Tests slow us down" | Short-term thinking | Tests enable speed long-term |
| "Good enough" | Gradual degradation | Maintain standards |
