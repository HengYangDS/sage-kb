### API Documentation
```python
def fetch_user(
    user_id: str,
    include_profile: bool = False,
    timeout: float = 30.0
) -> User:
    """Fetch a user by their unique identifier.
    
    Retrieves user data from the database, optionally including
    the full profile information.
    
    Args:
        user_id: Unique identifier (UUID format).
        include_profile: If True, includes profile data.
        timeout: Maximum wait time in seconds.
        
    Returns:
        User object with requested data.
        
    Raises:
        UserNotFoundError: If no user matches the ID.
        TimeoutError: If request exceeds timeout.
        
    Example:
        >>> user = fetch_user("abc-123", include_profile=True)
        >>> print(user.name)
        "Alice"
    """
```

## 4.3 Code Comments

### When to Comment
| Scenario | Comment Type | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Complex algorithm | Explain logic | `# Using Dijkstra's for shortest path` |
| Non-obvious decision | Explain why | `# JSON preferred over XML for browser compat` |
| Workaround | Document reason | `# HACK: API bug requires retry` |
| Public API | Full docstring | Args, Returns, Raises, Example |

### When NOT to Comment
```python
# BAD: Obvious comments
counter = 0  # Initialize counter to zero
counter += 1  # Increment counter

# GOOD: Self-documenting code
user_count = 0
user_count += 1
```
