## 1. Five Critical Questions

Ask before every task:

| # | Question                           | Purpose                |
|---|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | What assumptions am I making?      | Validate premises      |
| 2 | What could go wrong?               | Risk assessment        |
| 3 | Is there a simpler approach?       | Avoid over-engineering |
| 4 | Will this be maintainable?         | Long-term thinking     |
| 5 | How does this fit the big picture? | Context alignment      |
