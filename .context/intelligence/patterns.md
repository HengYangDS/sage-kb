## 1. Overview

This document captures successful AI collaboration patterns discovered during SAGE development. These patterns help
maintain consistency and efficiency in human-AI interactions.

### 1.1 Purpose

- Document proven interaction strategies
- Capture project-specific optimizations
- Track calibration data for autonomy levels
- Provide reference for future sessions

### 1.2 Pattern Categories

| Category              | Description                         |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Interaction**       | Communication and workflow patterns |
| **Knowledge Capture** | When and how to document knowledge  |
| **Optimization**      | Efficiency improvements             |
| **Calibration**       | Autonomy level adjustments          |

## 2. Interaction Patterns

### 2.1 Session Start Pattern

**Context**: Beginning a new collaboration session

**Pattern**:

1. Review `.junie/guidelines.md` for project context
2. Check `.history/current/` for active sessions
3. Review recent commits for context continuity
4. Establish task scope and autonomy level

**Benefits**: Faster context loading, consistent behavior

### 2.2 Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**Context**: Handling complex multi-step tasks

**Pattern**:

1. Start with high-level plan
2. Execute one step at a time
3. Report progress after each step
4. Adjust plan based on findings

**Benefits**: Maintains transparency, allows course correction

### 2.3 Clarification Request Pattern

**Context**: Ambiguous or incomplete requirements

**Pattern**:

1. State understanding of the requirement
2. List specific ambiguities
3. Propose default interpretation
4. Ask for confirmation or clarification

**Example**:

```
我理解您希望更新配置文件。有几点需要确认：
1. 是否包括所有子目录的配置？（默认：是）
2. 是否需要备份原文件？（默认：否）
请确认或调整。
```

### 2.4 Batch Operation Pattern

**Context**: Multiple similar changes across files

**Pattern**:

1. Identify all affected files first
2. Group by change type
3. Execute in batches with verification
4. Summarize changes at end

**Benefits**: Reduces errors, maintains consistency

## 3. Knowledge Capture Patterns

### 3.1 Decision Point Pattern

**When to capture**: Significant technical decisions made during development

**What to capture**:

- Context and constraints
- Options considered
- Decision rationale
- Expected consequences

**Where**: `.context/decisions/ADR-NNNN-*.md`

### 3.2 Convention Discovery Pattern

**When to capture**: New coding patterns or standards emerge

**What to capture**:

- Pattern description
- Usage examples
- When to apply
- Exceptions

**Where**: `.context/conventions/*.md`

### 3.3 Session Handoff Pattern

**When to capture**: End of significant work session

**What to capture**:

- Completed tasks
- Pending items
- Important findings
- Next steps

**Where**: `.history/handoffs/*.md`

### 3.4 Problem-Solution Pattern

**When to capture**: Solving non-trivial problems

**What to capture**:

- Problem description
- Investigation steps
- Root cause
- Solution applied

**Where**: Relevant documentation or `.history/conversations/`

## 4. Optimization Strategies

### 4.1 Context Window Optimization

**Strategy**: Minimize context while maximizing relevance

**Techniques**:

- Use targeted file searches over full directory scans
- Request specific line ranges when opening files
- Collapse completed plan items to save space
- Reference files by path instead of including content

### 4.2 Token Budget Management

**Strategy**: Stay within T4 (5s) timeout for most operations

**Techniques**:

- Load core knowledge first (highest priority)
- Use smart loading based on task type
- Implement graceful degradation for large requests
- Cache frequently accessed content

### 4.3 Parallel Task Execution

**Strategy**: Execute independent tasks concurrently

**Techniques**:

- Identify task dependencies
- Group independent operations
- Use batch commands where possible
- Verify results collectively

### 4.4 Error Recovery Strategy

**Strategy**: Graceful handling of failures

**Techniques**:

- Always have fallback approach
- Document partial progress
- Preserve work before risky operations
- Report issues with context

## 5. Calibration Data

### 5.1 Autonomy Level Calibration

Current calibration for SAGE project:

| Task Type             | Recommended Level | Notes                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Documentation updates | L5 (High)         | Well-established patterns  |
| Code formatting       | L5 (High)         | Ruff handles automatically |
| Bug fixes             | L4 (Medium-High)  | Verify with tests          |
| New features          | L3 (Medium)       | Discuss design first       |
| Architecture changes  | L2 (Low)          | Requires approval          |
| Breaking changes      | L1 (Minimal)      | Full review required       |

### 5.2 Response Time Expectations

| Operation           | Expected Time | Timeout Level |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Simple query        | < 100ms       | T1            |
| Single file read    | < 500ms       | T2            |
| Multi-file analysis | < 2s          | T3            |
| Full KB load        | < 5s          | T4            |
| Complex analysis    | < 10s         | T5            |

### 5.3 Quality Thresholds

| Metric        | Target | Action if Below        |
|---------------|--------|------------------------|
| Test coverage | > 80%  | Add tests before merge |
| Type coverage | > 90%  | Add type hints         |
| Doc coverage  | > 70%  | Add docstrings         |
| Complexity    | < 10   | Refactor function      |

## 6. Anti-Patterns

### 6.1 Avoid: Over-Engineering

**Problem**: Adding complexity for hypothetical future needs

**Instead**: Implement minimal solution, extend when needed

### 6.2 Avoid: Silent Assumptions

**Problem**: Proceeding without confirming ambiguous requirements

**Instead**: Use Clarification Request Pattern (2.3)

### 6.3 Avoid: Monolithic Changes

**Problem**: Large changes that are hard to review/revert

**Instead**: Use Batch Operation Pattern (2.4) with small commits

### 6.4 Avoid: Context Overload

**Problem**: Loading entire codebase into context

**Instead**: Use targeted searches and specific file sections
